# hello-world
Hi i'm kevin and im just new here and hope i can learn great things about programming because i'm a 2nd year IT student.
I joined github because it says it has free coding tutorial which catches my attention because i really suck at programming 
and i wish i could expand my knowledge here at GitHub.
